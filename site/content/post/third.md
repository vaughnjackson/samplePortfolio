# My new low score for 2017...[ 76 ]

When it all comes together it comes together. And for me it did on a nice brisk Saturday afternoon with mild wind gusts of 25mph +/-. I have a statistical history of doing well in windy conditions and I didn't fail to keep that trend going.

To get right to the point I scored a **76** on this day. After starting with a Bogie and then a Birdie...I went the first 4 holes even. Which on the course at Tangle Ridge is no joke. I continued to battle, but had 3 bogies in a row on holes that had 3 GIR's. 3 greens in regulation and followed by 3 putts on each freaking hole. 1 due to not reading the green properly, 1 with a lip out, and the other was a 75 foot first putt that came up short.

The key to this low round was the use of my Mini Driver set at 11 degrees, and I left my Drivers (4 to choose from) all at home. The fairway was the secret to a good score. I alos played my **Titleist 712 MB (Bladed) Irons**. It was a great day.

Until next time or once I conclude this post.
